# vue-webpack-plugin

> A boilerplate for a vue webpack plugin.

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ git clone https://github.com/unm-idi/vue-webpack-plugin.git
$ vue init vue-webpack-plugin my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If port 8080 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in `/config/index.js`. Otherwise `npm run dev` will fail.
